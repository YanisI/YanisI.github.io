      <h1>Protocols and communication</h1>
      <br>
      <h4> Wireless Sensor Network </h4>
      <br>
      <p class="justify">
        In this course, we used the bottom-up approach in order to focus on network metrics: cost, energy efficiency, robustness, lifespan, ease of deployment while keeping in mind the constraints of implementation. implementation and the compromises of the layer. <br>
        First, we did a study on a protocol. We have studied the Lora protocol, from the physical layer, through the MAC layer and the security of this protocol, to energy consumption. The report and slides are available below:
      </p>

          Protocols for WSN : LoRa - Slides
        </p>
      </a>
    </p>
      <p class="justify"> Secondly, we looked at the Mac protocols dedicated to Wireless Sensor Network. We had to select the protocols that we must present because of their very large numbers. We have tried to select one or two protocols per category. For each of its protocols, we have specified the Channel Access Type, synchronization or non-synchronization, the specificities of the protocol, if it includes mobility, location and security mechanisms. <br>The report and slides are available below :

      <h4> From 3G to 5G </h4>
      <p class="justify">
        In this course, we took a look at the technologies currently deployed around the world for mobile networks, from 3G to 5G. We have seen the technological advances that each innovation and generation brings.
        <br>The slides are available below :

      </p>
      <br>
      <h4> Energy for connected objects </h4>
       <p class="justify">
        During this course, we were introduced to technologies allowing to stock electrical energy by using Electrochemical and Electrostatic energy storage. We have seen this aspect for the IoT to make connected objects energetically autonomous.
      </p>
      <br>
      <h4> Emerging Networks </h4>
       <p class="justify">
        During this courses, we were introduced to different types of network like software defined network (SDN). The main goal was to understand the new emerging networks that are very usefull in an IoT context. We have two practical works whose goal is to make us discover OpenFlow which allows the creation of SDN architecture.

      <h3> Skills developped</h3>
      <br>
      <h4> Protocols and communication </h4>
      <h5> Understand and master the new mobile networks technologies (3)</h5>
       <p class="justify">  
        The 3G to 5G course, allowed us to understand how works the different generation of mobile network and evolve according to the demand. But due to the lack of practical works i don't think I master this unit that's why I assess myself to 3 to this skill. 
      </p>

      <h5> Be able to analyse and evaluate protocoles dedicated to WSN / IoT (4)</h5>
       <p class="justify">  
        The courses and the research work on the MAC protocols for Wireless Sensor Network allow us to be able to assess the fundamental protocols dedicated to WSN on different criteria such as mobility, geolocation, synchronization and consumption.
      </p>

      <h5> Understand and master the fundamentals of emerging network paradigms applied to IoT (4)</h5>
      <p class="justify">  
        During this course, we saw new type of networks that can be designed for IoT. One of the protocol we saw was Software defined networking (SDN). It that enables dynamic, programmatically efficient network configuration in order to improve network performance and monitoring.
      </p>
      <h5> Understand and master the optimisation of IoT communication protocols at MAC level(4)</h5>
      <p class="justify">  
        Thanks to the work we did on MAC-level protocols for Wireless Sensor Network, we were able to learn in depth about the protocols that concern the MAC layer for IoT networks. Moreover, with the first presentation on LoRa, we saw the security mechanism on the LoRaWAN network.
      </p>
      <h5> Understand and master the security mechanismes of IoT communication protocols (3)</h5>
      <p class="justify">  
        In this course, we have seen the aspects of security. Who are the attackers, their motivations, the attacks ... However, I do not rate myself at 4 but at 3 because we did not carry out practical work following the readings..
      </p>
      <h5> Mastering the architecture of an energy management system (3)</h5>
      <p class="justify">  
        The course addressed the issue of energy issues in an IoT environment. We have seen different ways to supply energy to these IoT modules and see in each case the pros and cons.
