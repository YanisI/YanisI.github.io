      <h4> Processing Semantic Data </h4>
      <br>
      <p class="justify">  
        We used Protégé which allows the creation of ontologies. We have manipulated them, by defining ontologies related to time and its measurable parameters, and populated. We have also seen the possible deductions of the Protégé reasoner at different stages of the development of the ontology.
      </p>

      <p class="justify"> Then, we used Apache Jena and start from an existing dataset. We completed it with links between them. Then, we exported the knowledge of our ontology in Protégé before observing the result. <br> Report link below:</p>

      <h4> Data Processing and Analysis: Big Data </h4>
      <br>
      <p class="justify">
        To familiarize ourselves with the R language, we first learned how to create and manipulate vectors in several ways. We gradually increased the difficulty by using new R-specific features like which or strsplit. Through several exercises, we were introduced to functions and finally to data sets. We have learned to manipulate data sets, in particular with the use of ddply which we have used a lot. Finally, we learned how to use ggplot to display data as a graph.
      </p>

      <p class="justify"> Subsequently, we had a data analysis project to carry out. We were asked to study a data set that we can choose. The analysis of this one had to bring out at least 5 graphs. We have chosen a data set on video game sales. It contained data on the sales of video games released between 1980 and 2016. Each game had data on its sales by region (Europe, Japan, North America, Others and total), its genre and its console. <br> Report link below:</p>

      <h3> Skills developped</h3>
      <br>
      <h4> Processing Semantic Data </h4>
      <h5> Design and understand a model for an application (4)</h5>
       <p class="justify">  
        During the Practical Work, we designed an ontology for the weather. We used Protégé's reasoner to "find" implicit knowledge. So we have learned to create and nourish an ontology with knowledge. 
      </p>

      <h5> Know how to infer new knowlegde from a knowledge base (4)</h5>
       <p class="justify">  
        As explained above, we used Protégé's reasoner to find implicit knowledge from the already knowledgable base.
      </p>

      <h5> Be able to enrich data with semantic meta-data (4)</h5>
      <p class="justify">  
        During lab lessons on semantic web, we created a Java code which was able to automatically enrich data with semantic meta-data thanks to the ontology we had created.


      </p>
      <br>
      <h4> Data Processing and Analysis: Big Data </h4>
      <br>
      <h5> Know how to explore and represent data sets (4) </h5>
      <p class="justify">
        Throughout our practical work, we have studied, manipulated and created many datasets. In particular, we used the ddply function which allowed us to easily shape the datasets with the information that interested us. We also learned how to use the ggplot function to graph the observed data.
      </p>
      <h5> Master R (3) </h5>
      <p class="justify"> 
        We worked during the practical sessions and for the project with the R language. We learned to process and graphically represent data from a dataset. We have been introduced to the R language and have gained a solid foundation in its use, however, I think what we have seen does not currently mark this skill as mastered (4/4) as we have explored only one way to 'use and represent datasets using ddply to process them and ggplot to represent them.
      </p>

      <h5> Master complexity associated to statistical data processing and know the techniques to be used to minimise them (3) </h5>
      <p class = "justify">
         We saw the complexity issue during the lessons, but since we didn't see it during the labs, I am not confident in these skills and that's why I did not score 4.
