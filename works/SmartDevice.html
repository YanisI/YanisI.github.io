      <h4> Introduction to Sensors</h4>
      <br>
      <h5> AIME : Nano-Sensor </h5>
      <p class="justify">
        In this project, we designed a nanoparticle sensor starting from the synthesis of WO3 nanoparticles. We have characterized the sensor produced under different gaseous atmospheres. The final objective was to produce a datasheet.
        <br>
        The Datasheet is avaible here : 
        <a href="../Datasheet.pdf" target="_blank">
          Datasheet
        </a>
      </p>
         The whole realization is broken down into 4 main parts.
      </p>

      <br>

      <h5> I - Sythesis of WO3 nanoparticles</h5>

      <p class="justify">
       To prepare the solution containing the nanoparticles, we started with a hydrolysis-condesation of Na2WO4 solution. We followed the protocol (below) under safety rules to avoid any risks (due to the use of nanoparticles). In addition, the protocol tended to limit the ecological impact as much as possible, mainly by limiting the waste produced.
      </p>

      <img src="../img/synthesis.PNG" class="centeredPicture">

      <h5> II - Elaboration of the microelectronic chip </h5>

      <p class="justify"> 

      The sensor is made up of 3 parts: a doped poly-silicon heating resistor, an aluminum resistance for heating and two interdigitated combs where the layer of nanoparticles will be deposited and which will then become our resistors sensitive to the gaseous environment.
        
      </p>
      <img src="../img/Sensor.PNG" class="centeredPicture" >

      <h5> III - Integration of the sensitive nanoparticle layer on the chip </h5>

      <p class="justify">
        For the integration of nanoparticles into the sensor, we used Dielectrophoresis (DEP) method. We connect the sensor and we apply a non-uniform electric field on a dielectric particle. Consequently, fields of a particular frequency can manipulate particles with great selectivity and our particles will, thanks to the dielectrophoretic force, integrate on the comb. This method last for a minute and we then can see the result on the microscope.
      </p> 
      <img src="../img/AimeSensor.PNG" class="centeredPicture" >

      <h5> IV - Electrical characterization of the sensor in a controlled atmosphere</h5>

      <p>
        Once our nanoparticle sensor was ready, we characterized it. First, we measured the resistance values ​​of the sensor using Ohm's law. We obtained different curves (available in the datasheet). <br>


        Subsequently, we recorded the response of the gas sensor. We measured the variation of the sensitive layer in the presence of a specific gas at one given concentration in synthetic dry air by following a protocol established to test the response and regeneration thereof. We used two gases which are ethanol and ammonium. The characterization procedure was designed to alternate dry air and air with the desired gas.
        <br>
        <br>
        The procedure can be seen below:

      <h4> Microcontrollers and Open Source Hardware </h4>
      <br>
      <h5>  Design of the sensor’s conditioner </h5>
      <p class="justify">
        The sensor having a very large resistance does not allow direct measurement of the signal having a current of 100 nA. In order to have a usable signal, we need a conditioning stage. Our conditioner will aim to amplify the signal while filtering the noise.

        We have produced and tested the following conditioner under LTSpice:
      </p>
      <img src="../img/LTSpice.PNG" class="centeredPicture" >
      
      <h5>  Design of the gas sensor's shield </h5>
      <p class="justify">
        Then come the shield design. After having tested and validated the conditioner, we went to the shield. We will be using KiCad to create the PCB. KiCad is a software that allows us to perform routing and visualize the final result in 3D. We integrate our conditioner on KiCad in addition to adding the RN2483 and the arduino uno for data communication. 
      </p>

      <br>
      <img src="../img/Kicad3D.PNG" class="centeredPicture">
      <br>
      <h5> Arduino Uno for LoRa communication and sensor integration  </h5>
      <p class="justify">
         We needed our gas sensor to be able to communicate in order to be used in an IoT environment. We are going to use an Aruino nano coupled to an RN2483 chip for communication. After soldering and connecting the pins, and with the help of TheThingsNetwork (TTN) library our board was able to communicate and send measurements to the TTN site at regular intervals.
         <br>
         <img src="../img/TTN.PNG" class="centeredPicture">
         When developing the diagram, we took into account the energy consumption. As our sensor only had to send data at certain times, it was not necessary to power the card continuously. We therefore used a transistor in order to optimize consumption and to supply the card only when sending data.
      </p>
      <br>
      <h5> Node-Red Human-machine interface </h5>
      <p class="justify">

         <br>
          We used node-red to create a dashboard that allows us to record the measurements and display them in a simple interface. So, on node-red, we realized the flow we wanted to make, starting from a payload reception (ttn uplink), a 'decoding' function, and then a display in the dashboard.
