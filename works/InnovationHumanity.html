    <h1>Innovation and Humanity</h1>
    <br>
    <h4> Manage an innovative project </h4>
    <p class="justify">  
      During this course, we learned about the innovation method that is the TRIZ. TRIZ is a method bringing together a set of tools for inventive problem solving. We studied an everyday object and applied the TRIZ method to it in order to have a better idea of ​​how innovations work.
    </p>

    <p class="justify"> 
      For the completed project, I chose the toothbrush and made an S-curve, a functional diagram and established the 9 laws of the TRIZ to this object.

    <p class="justify"> 
      We also worked in groups on a more advanced subject. Our subject was "Conflict management and decision making" which deals with the reason and type of conflict, the types of personality that can be involved in a conflict as well as the ways to manage them.

    <p class="justify">
      During this course, we learned the different steps to complete a project. We saw the stages of launching the project with the importance of clearly defining the expectations, the techniques that we want to implement for our project and the scheduling and organization.

      <h3> Skills developped</h3>
      <br>
      <h4> Manage an innovative project </h4>
      <h5> Solve a problem in a creative way (4)</h5>
       <p class="justify">  
        We have seen in the lessons the different methods of creativity (like TRIZ methodology) and have used his knowledge during the TRIZ project in order to solve problems in a creative way. 
      </p>
      <h5> Develop the first stage of innovation (4)</h5>
       <p class="justify">  
        During the Creativity method project sessions, we used our knowledge of the TRIZ methodology in order to explore a potentially improved branch of our object of study.
      </p>
      <h5> Understand production, validation, distribution, acceptability and aftermath of innovation (4)</h5>
      <p class="justify">  
        During TRIZ courses, we saw the entire process of innovation. We have seen the different stages of an innovation and the importance of each of them so that the invention becomes an innovation.
      </p>
      <h5> Structure and lead an innovative project (4)</h5>
      <p class="justify">  
        Innovation and Business Management taught us how to lead an innovative project thanks to precise project management phases.
      </p>
      <br>

      <h4> Learn teamwork </h4>
      <h5> Multi-disciplinary students work as a team (4) </h5>
      <p class="justify">
        Through my studies and particularly since I arrived at INSA, I have learned to work in a group, to divide up tasks, to help and consult each other in order to be as effective as possible as a team.
      </p>
      <br>

      <h4> Be convincing : present and defend an idea </h4>
      <h5> Express and exchange hypotheses (4) </h5>
      <p class = "justify">
        During social psychology classes, we debated and exchanged on ethical issues. This allowed us to take a step back from our projects and the ethical problems it could represent.
      </p>
      <h5> Suggest a strategy to solve the problem identified (4)</h5>
      <p class = "justify">
        We made a presentation on "Conflict management and decision making" in social psychology. We learned from our research how to solve problems related to social interactions and what behavior to adopt when these situations arise. In addition, in team management, we have also seen the importance of taking a step back and the place of the manager in order to solve problems by confronting them and not by avoiding them.
      </p>
      <h5> Suggest a model (4) </h5>
      <p class = "justify">
         During the planning phase carried out at the start of our project, we suggested an application model for our edge computing car park project.
      </p>
      <h5> Choose, design and/or justify a protocol or an experimental prototype (4) </h5>
      <p class = "justify">
         During the innovative project courses, we worked as a team to agree on the prototype of the application to be provided in order to meet the specifications for our edge computing car park project.
      </p>
      <br>

      <h4> Self Evaluation with portfolio </h4>
      <h5> Reflect upon my training process and methods (4) </h5>
      <p class = "justify">
         I learned to take a step back from what we learned during the multitude of courses taken this year in Innovative Smart System and the skills developed.
      </p>
      <h5> Be able to put forward my training experiences, whether they be explicit or implicit (4) </h5>
      <p class = "justify">
         Through the realization of this portfolio, I learned to highlight my experiences carried out throughout this year, what they brought me and what I learned from them.
      </p>
      <h5> Be self sufficient and responsible towards my education (4) </h5>
      <p class = "justify">
        This year in particular was very demanding in terms of organization and self-learning due to the format of the year in Innovative Smart System but also the health crisis of covid 19 which prompted INSA and the students to review their way of working.
